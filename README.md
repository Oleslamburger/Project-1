# Project-1


In this project, we are doing an analysis of how students' test scores and academic performance in general are affected by multiple factors.

We are using Pandas, NumPy, MathPlotLib, SeaBorn, and SciPy for this project. 

We plot the relationships between different categories and average scores and calculate the p-value to make our conclusion.
Alternative Hypothesis: A favorable student environment positively affects academic performance. 
From our analysis, we can confidently say that students’ nutrition and parents’ educational backgrounds are the most impactful factors in academic results. We found that transportation and parents' marital status don't have a big impact on the student's impact.
