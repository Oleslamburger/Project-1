I'm Luvin it Mcluvin

In this project, we are doing analysis on how students' test score and academic performance in general are affected by multiple factors.

We are using Pandas, NumPy, MathPlotLib, SeaBorn and SciPy for this project. 

We plot the relationships between different catagories and average score, calculate the p-value to make our conclusion.
